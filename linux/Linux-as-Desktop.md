Prevent Files And Folders From Accidental Deletion Or Modification In Linux Using Chattr
By default, Chattr comes pre-installed in many Linux operating systems. So let us not bother about installation.
The default syntax of chattr command is:

chattr [operator] [switch] [filename]
chattr has the following operators:

The operator '+' causes the selected attributes to be added to the existing attributes of the files.
The operator '-' causes them to be removed.
The operator '=' causes them to be the only attributes that the files have.
